# Summary: Release Notes Rewrite Complete

## Task Completed ✅

The release notes for **"Keen Classik ARM64 Release - 2026-01-05"** (tag `v1.0-classik-arm64-release`) have been rewritten from a self-congratulatory QA report into user-focused release notes.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Release Notes
**File**: `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0-classik-arm64.md`

The new release notes:
- ✅ Explain what the game is (KenKen-style logic puzzle)
- ✅ Focus on features users care about
- ✅ Include clear installation instructions
- ✅ Are honest about limitations (debug build)
- ✅ Remove all internal QA metrics and self-praise

### 2. Created Update Script
**File**: `scripts/update-release-notes.sh`

An automated script that:
- ✅ Validates prerequisites (`gh` CLI installed)
- ✅ Checks GitHub authentication
- ✅ Updates the GitHub release with new notes
- ✅ Has proper error handling
- ✅ Is executable (mode 755)

### 3. Created Documentation

**Files**:
- `RELEASE_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step update guide
- `RELEASE_NOTES_COMPARISON.md` - Before/after analysis

## How to Apply These Changes

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to the repository root
cd /home/runner/work/KeenKenning/KeenKenning

# Ensure you're authenticated with GitHub
gh auth login

# Run the update script
./scripts/update-release-notes.sh
```

### Alternative Methods
See `RELEASE_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for:
1. Manual `gh` CLI commands
2. GitHub web interface instructions (copy/paste)

## Key Improvements

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Focus** | Internal QA | User experience |
| **Tone** | Self-congratulatory | Informative |
| **Jargon** | High (QA metrics) | Low (clear language) |
| **Honesty** | Claims perfection | Acknowledges limitations |
| **Usefulness** | Low (internal) | High (practical) |

## Examples of Changes

### ❌ Removed (Self-Congratulatory)
- "Build: SUCCESSFUL (zero warnings, -Werror enforced)"
- "Tests: 70/70 PASS (54 unit + 16 instrumented)"
- "Defects: ZERO found"
- "Regressions: ZERO detected"
- "Production-ready for immediate deployment"
- Entire "Quality Assurance" section

### ✅ Added (User-Focused)
- "A traditional KenKen-style logic puzzle game for Android"
- "What's New in v1.0" section with real features
- "Getting Started" instructions
- "Known Issues" acknowledging debug build
- "What's Next" teasing future features
